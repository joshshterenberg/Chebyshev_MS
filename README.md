# Chebyshev Multiplier Sequences
### By Andrzej Piotrowski and Joshua Shterenberg

## Overview and How To Build

Abstract: We demonstrate that a multiplier sequence for the Chebyshev basis cannot be interpolated by a polynomial of odd degree. We exhibit this by direct algebraic proof and by utilizing various computational methods for both preliminary proofs and for the symbolic interpretation of required sequences. Additionally, we provide a basis for continued research for extensions of this basis set into the Gegenbauer and Jacobi basis sets, as well as a preliminary analysis of the even degree multiplier sequences as linear operators of these sets.
